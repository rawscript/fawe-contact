                <p class="section-subtitle">
  <strong>Tuseme</strong> — a Swahili word meaning “Let Us Speak Out” — is a student-led empowerment initiative
  designed to amplify the voices of learners, especially girls, within school communities.<br><br>

  Rooted in participatory theatre and life skills education, Tuseme Clubs equip students with the confidence,
  leadership, and advocacy tools to identify challenges, speak out, and take action.<br><br>

  Founded on the principles of gender equity, child rights, and inclusive participation, the clubs foster a safe
  space for learners to express themselves, engage with school leadership, and drive positive change in their
  academic and social environments.
